## Overview

This project implements multiple algorithms for solving wooden calendar puzzles, progressing from brute-force approaches to optimized dynamic programming solutions. The puzzle involves placing 10 wooden pieces on a 7Ã—8 board to cover all squares except for a specific date (day + month + weekday in Turkish).

## The Puzzle

- **Board**: 7Ã—8 grid with numbers 1-31, Turkish month abbreviations, and Turkish day abbreviations
- **Pieces**: 10 wooden pieces of varying shapes (tetrominos and pentominos)
- **Objective**: Cover all squares except the target date
- **Constraints**: No overlaps, no gaps, all pieces must be used

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Brute-Force Solver (`calendar_puzzle_solver.py`)
A straightforward backtracking implementation featuring:
- Complete piece transformation handling (rotations and reflections)
- Systematic search through all possibilities
- Clear, readable code structure suitable for understanding the problem

### 2. Dynamic Programming Solver (`dp_calendar_solver.py`)
An optimized version using memoization:
- Bit manipulation for efficient board state representation
- Memoization with `(board_mask, used_pieces)` cache keys
- Significant performance improvement over brute-force

### 3. Fast Solver (`fast_dp_solver.py`)
A highly optimized implementation with:
- LRU caching using Python's `@lru_cache` decorator
- First-empty-cell heuristic for improved search ordering
- Precomputed piece placement tables
- Minimal state representation

### 4. Solution Viewer (`viewer.py`)
A utility for visualizing solutions:
- ASCII art rendering of board states
- Command-line interface for easy date queries
- Clear piece identification with symbols

## Performance Comparison

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Usage | Cache Strategy |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Brute-Force | O(10! Ã— orientations) | 2D arrays | None |
| Dynamic Programming | O(states Ã— pieces) | Bit masks | Manual memoization |
| Fast Solver | O(states) | Compressed states | LRU automatic |

Results show significant speedup from brute-force to optimized DP, with the fast solver achieving sub-second solving times for individual dates.

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Solve and visualize a specific date
python viewer.py 2024-03-15

# Run performance comparison
python compare_solvers.py

# Solve all dates with fast solver
python fast_dp_solver.py
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from fast_dp_solver import FastCalendarPuzzleSolver

solver = FastCalendarPuzzleSolver()
solutions = solver.solve_for_date(15, 3, 5)  # March 15th, Friday

# Visualization
from viewer import print_solution_for_date
print_solution_for_date("2024-03-15")
```

## Technical Features

### Optimization Techniques
- **Bit manipulation**: Board states represented as 64-bit integers
- **Memoization**: Caching of intermediate results to avoid redundant computation
- **Heuristics**: First-empty-cell search ordering for better pruning
- **Precomputation**: Valid piece placements calculated once at startup

### Data Structures
- Position-to-bit mapping for efficient board operations
- Precomputed orientation tables for all pieces
- Cache-friendly state representations

### Code Organization
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation and type hints
- Performance measurement and comparison tools
- JSON output format for solution storage

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `fast_dp_solver.py` | Optimized solver with LRU caching |
| `dp_calendar_solver.py` | DP implementation with manual memoization |
| `calendar_puzzle_solver.py` | Brute-force baseline implementation |
| `viewer.py` | Solution visualization tool |
| `compare_solvers.py` | Performance benchmarking |
| `dp_calendar_solutions.json` | Complete solution database (28K+ solutions) |

## Results

The project successfully finds solutions for valid calendar dates, with over 28,000 solutions stored in the complete database. The fast solver can process individual dates in sub-second time, making it practical for interactive use.
